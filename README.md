# Introduction

OpenSRP Client Native Form Module/app provides the ability to easily create Android forms using JSON forms.

Thanks to this [Android Native JSON Form Library](https://github.com/vijayrawatsan/android-json-form-wizard) from which OpenSRP Client Native Form has been customised to fit OpenSRP Requirements

> **NOTE**
>
> **JSON Form** is written using **JSON (syntax)** which can be found [here](http://json.org/).


# Features

1. It enables definition of Android forms in JSON
2. It enables one to define metadata for OpenMRS forms
3. It enables one to define validations for form inputs in JSON
   * [Regular Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) validation rules
   * Number validation rules
   * Alphabetic & alphanumeric validation rules in JSON
4. It enables one to define form input constraints using JSON
   * Min value
   * Max value
5. It enables one to define OpenMRS mappings in JSON
6. It enables one to define skip logic for fields based on values entered in other fields

# App Walkthrough

# Usage

Here are a few instructions on how to write the JSON Form:


```
//Start of your JSON FORM
{
    "count":1,
    "encounter_type":"Birth Registration",
    "mother":{

    },
    "entity_id":"",
    "relational_id":"",
    "metadata":{

    },
    "step1":{
        "title":"Birth Registration",
        "fields":[
            {
                "type":"edit_text",
                "openmrs_entity_id":"",
                "hint":"First name",
                "key":"First_Name",
                "v_regex":{
                    "value":"[A-Za-z]*",
                    "err":"Please enter a valid name"
                }
            },
            {

            }
        ]
    },

}

```

# Developer Documentation

This section will provide a brief description how to build and install the application from the repository source code.


## Pre-requisites

1. Make sure you have Java 1.7 to 1.8 installed
2. Make sure you have Android Studio installed or [download it from here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)


## Installation Devices

1. Use a physical Android device to run the app
2. Use the Android Emulator that comes with the Android Studio installation (Slow & not advisable)
3. Use Genymotion Android Emulator
    * Go [here](https://www.genymotion.com/) and register for genymotion account if none. Free accounts have limitations which are not counter-productive
    * Download your OS Version of VirtualBox at [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
    * Install VirtualBox
    * Download Genymotion & Install it
    * Sign in to the genymotion app
    * Create a new Genymotion Virtual Device
        * **Preferrable & Stable Choice** - API 22(Android 5.1.0), Screen size of around 800 X 1280, 1024 MB Memory --> eg. Google Nexus 7, Google Nexus 5

## How to install

1. Import the project into Android Studio by: **Import a gradle project** option
   _All the plugins required are explicitly stated therefore can work with any Android Studio version - Just enable it to download any packages not available offline_
1. Open Genymotion and Run the Virtual Device created previously.
1. Run the app on Android Studio and chose the Genymotion Emulator as the ` Deployment Target`


## Android Implementation Code


```
//Other imports here ...
import com.vijay.jsonwizard.activities.JsonFormActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private static final int REQUEST_CODE_GET_JSON = 1234;

    //.. Initialisation methods here

    public void startForm(int jsonFormActivityRequestCode,
                              String formName, String entityId) throws Exception {

        //Inject OpenMRS MetaData into the form here...

        Intent intent = new Intent(this, JsonFormActivity.class);
        intent.putExtra("json", form.toString());
        startActivityForResult(intent, jsonFormActivityRequestCode);
    }

    public JSONObject getFormJson(String formIdentity) {
        try {
            InputStream inputStream = getApplicationContext().getAssets()
                    .open("json.form/" + formIdentity + ".json");
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream,
                    "UTF-8"));
            String jsonString;
            StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
            while ((jsonString = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                stringBuilder.append(jsonString);
            }
            inputStream.close();

            return new JSONObject(stringBuilder.toString());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        return null;
    }

    //Handle the result returned...

```


## Customisations From Android Native JSON Form

Some customisations were done on the parent library to fit OpenSRP requirements. Below are the customisations:

1. Input field mappings to OpenMRS entity fields i.e. [OpenMRS Keys](#openmrs-keys)

2. Default metadata (`metadata` field) for each JSON FORM i.e.
   * Objects
      * `start` - Object with the time the form is openned for editing
         * `value` - Date time value in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`
      * `end` - Time the form is completed
         * `value` - Date time value in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`
      * `today` - Day the form was completed
         * `value` - Date value in the format `dd-MM-yyyy`
      * `deviceid` - Unique identifier of the provider device
      * `subscriberid` - Unique Subscriber ID based on Service Provider eg. `IMSI` will be returned for a `GSM Phone`
      * `simserial` - SIM card Serial Number, if one is available
      * `phonenumber` - Phone number for SIM 1 eg. the `MSISDN` for a `GSM Phone`
      * `encounter_location` - Health Facility Zone where the encounter happened
      * `look_up` - JSON Object describing any lookup data selected in a form lookup field. It basically has:
         * `entity_id` - The unique entity name eg. `mother`
         * `value` - The unique entity identifier eg. `9898-sd23D-f523a`

> ### OpenMRS Keys
>
> Each metadata field objects above have the following properties:
>    * `key`
>    * `openmrs_entity_parent`
>    * `openmrs_entity`
>    * `openmrs_data_type`
>    * `openmrs_entity_id`

3. Mandatory fields for each JSON Form i.e.
   * `encounter_type` - This can be either of the [encounter types below](#encounter-types) or `blank` if the encounter type is not supported by OpenMRS
   * `entity_id` - Unique identifier

### Encounter Types

Below are the most common encounter types:

Encounter Type | Description
-------------- | -----------
Birth Registration | Child enrollment
AEFI | Adverse Effect of vaccines, supplements or other services given by providers
HIA2 Monthly Report | Monthly health reports written by providers
Out of Catchment Service | Health service provision to a patient outside the patient's registered location eg. During `relative visits`, `temporary relocation`
Death | A deceased child/patient is reported


4. Validations & Constraints for input fields i.e.
   * `v_regex` - This is used for validating input using [Regular Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
   * `v_min` - This validation ensures input entered is not below minimum value stated
   * `v_max` - Ensure that the input entered is not above the maximum value stated
   * `v_min_length` - Ensure that the number of characters entered is above the minimum value stated
   * `v_max_length` - Ensure that the number of characters entered is not above the maximum value stated

The Number Selector widget has constraints which can be defined in either of two ways
   * Using the Rules engine as shown below
```
,
    "constraints": {
      "rules-engine": {
        "ex-rules": {
          "rules-file": "sample-constraint-rules.yml"
        }
  }
}

```

```
name: step1_numbers_selector_three
description: Number Selectors
priority: 1
condition: "true"
actions:
  - "constraint = (step1_numbers_selector - step1_numbers_selector_two)"

```
 * Using the legacy approach
 ```
     "constraints": [
       {
         "type": "numbers_selector",
         "ex": "lessThanEqualTo(., step1:numbers_selector)"
       }
     ]

```
NB: The constraints for the Number Selector widget restrict the maximum value for the widget whose constraint is defined.


5. Different types of comparisons were added for the **Skip Logic**

This enables a field to be shown only if the condition set in `'ex'` is `True`

Skip Logic is defined using the `"relevance"` value

#### Sample Skip Logic

```
"relevance": {
          "step1:Place_Birth": {
            "type": "string",
            "ex": "equalTo(., \"Health facility\")"
          }
        }
```
The field above will only be shown if the value for field whose key is `Place_Birth`, which is the **Patient's Place of Birth (Location)**, is equals to `"Health Facility"`

```
      {
        "key": "isDateOfBirthUnknown",
        "openmrs_entity_parent": "",
        "openmrs_entity": "",
        "openmrs_entity_id": "",
        "type": "check_box",
        "label": "",
        "options": [
          {
            "key": "isDateOfBirthUnknown",
            "text": "DOB unknown?",
            "value": "false"
          }
        ]
      }
```
```
        "relevance": {
          "step1:isDateOfBirthUnknown": {
            "type": "string",
            "ex": "equalTo(., \"true\")"
          }
        }
```
The above is an example showing an example with a checkbox field

The following are the available comparators:
   * Equal To - `equalTo`
   * Greater Than - `greaterThan`
   * Greater Than or Equal To - `greaterThanEqualTo`
   * Less Than - `lessThan`
   * Less Than or Equal To - `lessThanEqualTo`
   * Not Equal To - `notEqualTo`
   * Regex Comparison - `regex`

The comparators work on the following variable types:
   * String - `string`
   * Numeric `numeric` - Integer, double, float ...
   * Date `date` - In the format `dd-MM-yyyy`
   * Array `array` - Arrays are said to be similar if:
      * Have the same number of items
      * Have same items in equal number, irrespective of index

The syntax for the comparison expression `ex`:

`equalTo(., "Health facility")`

 is as follows:

`comparator($value1, $value2)`

`$value1` is supposed to be a dot `.` so that the value `$value1` is that of the referenced field --> `Place_Birth` in `step1`.

The field reference/identifier uses the field's `key` attribute


### Skip logic for Checkbox group widget

Check boxes can also be selected multiple times . The corresponding skip logic can also thus become complex. In the example below, *(present in the sample app)*,
the CHW Phone Number Widget will only show based on these various conditions:
1. Severe Bleeding is checked
2. Both Perineal Tear and Placenta Previa are checked
3. Both Cord Prolapse and Abnormal Presentation checked or just Prolonged Obstructed Labour is checked

The implementation introduces a new field `ex-checkbox` which contains the complex checkbox expression, the example for the above 3 conditions is as below.
The relevant keys of the multi-select checkbox are specified as arrays wrapped with an object key of either `and` or `or` or `both` to be used for simple boolean logic processing.

```
,
        "relevance": {
          "step1:delivery_complications": {
            "ex-checkbox": [
              {
                "or": ["severe_bleeding"]
              },
              {
                "and": ["perineal_tear","placenta_previa"]
              },
              {
                "and": [
                  "cord_prolapse",
                  "abnormal_presentation"
                ],
                "or": [
                  "prolonged_obstructed_labour"
                ]
              }
            ]
          }

```

```
   {
        "key": "delivery_complications",
        "openmrs_entity_parent": "",
        "openmrs_entity": "concept",
        "openmrs_entity_id": "161641AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
        "openmrs_data_type": "select one",
        "type": "check_box",
        "label": "Any delivery complications?",
        "label_text_size": "18sp",
        "label_text_color": "#FF9800",
        "hint": "Any delivery complications?",
        "exclusive": ["none"],
        "options": [
          {
            "key": "none",
            "text": "None",
            "value": false,
            "openmrs_choice_id": "160034AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
          },
          {
            "key": "severe_bleeding",
            "text": "Severe bleeding/Hemorrhage",
            "value": false,
            "openmrs_choice_id": "160034AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
            "text_color": "#000000"
          },
          {
            "key": "placenta_previa",
            "text": "Placenta previa",
            "value": false,
            "openmrs_choice_id": "160034AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
            "text_size": "30sp"
          },
          {
            "key": "cord_prolapse",
            "text": "Cord prolapse",
            "value": false,
            "openmrs_choice_id": "160034AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
            "text_size": "10sp"
          },
          {
            "key": "prolonged_obstructed_labour",
            "text": "Prolonged/obstructed labour",
            "value": false,
            "openmrs_choice_id": "160034AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
          },
          {
            "key": "abnormal_presentation",
            "text": "Abnormal presentation",
            "value": false,
            "openmrs_choice_id": "160034AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
            "text_color": "#FF9800"
          },
          {
            "key": "perineal_tear",
            "text": "Perineal tear (2, 3 or 4th degree)",
            "value": false,
            "openmrs_choice_id": "160034AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
          },
          {
            "key": "other",
            "text": "Other",
            "value": false,
            "openmrs_choice_id": "160034AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
          }
        ],
        "v_required": {
          "value": "false"
        }
      }
```
The above relevance example shows a multiple select checkbox example and its used in the sample demo app for the CHW_Phone_Number widget.

If you want to specify relevance on the basis of whether a particular value HAS NOT been checked/selected use the `not` key field as shown below. Here, the widget will not show if the `severe bleeding` option has been selected

```
  "relevance": {
          "step1:delivery_complications": {
            "ex-checkbox": [
              {
                "not": ["severe_bleeding"]
              }]
           }
```

 ### Checkbox Exclusive Select field
 The checkbox implementation also introduces a new field `exclusive` in which you specify the array value of a key or set of keys e.g. `exclusive: ["none"]` which if selected excludes/clears all other entries.
 e.g. in the above example the exclusive key array contains the key `"none"` , thus selecting the item with key none on the multi-select checkbox clears all others.


### Skip logic using the rules engine

 OpenSRP Client Native Forms is now integrated with a rules engine for skip logic and also complex fields calculations. We use the J-Easy Library which can be found [Here](https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules).
 Rules are defined in yaml configuration files that are stored in the `assets/rule` folder. You can define multiple rules in multiple configs to be used by one json form

 When defining the skip logic and calculations for your forms keep Calculations and Relevance in separate files. e.g if i am doing a form called `physical_exam` , under `assets/rules` i should have two files namely
 `physical-exam-relevance-rules.yml`
 `physical-exam-calculations-rules.yml`

 You can name the files any thing you want so long as you don't mix calculations and relevance definitions.

 Separating and naming the files this way per form is however the recommended approach

 The j-easy library uses MVEL expression language which is java like to define its rules. There are a few subtle differences but those can be found in the MVEL Documentation [Here](http://mvel.documentnode.com/)

 Once you have the rules defined, you need to reference them like this in the form's json

```
{
        "key": "happiness_level",
        "openmrs_entity_parent": "",
        "openmrs_entity": "person_attribute",
        "openmrs_entity_id": "calculation_happiness_level",
        "type": "edit_text",
        "calculation": {
          "rules-engine": {
            "ex-rules": {
              "rules-file": "sample-calculation-rules.yml"
            }
          }
        },
         "relevance": {
           "rules-engine": {
             "ex-rules": {
               "rules-file": "sample-relevance-rules.yml"
             }
           }
         }
      }
```
In the example above, the relevance and the calculations for the edit text with key `happiness_level` are defined in the `assets/rule/sample-relevance-rules.yml` and `assets/rule/sample-calculation-rules.yml` files respectively.
The calculation setting here means that the value for this field is calculated rather than entered, its calculation rules being defined in the `sample-calculation-rules.yml` file.

The Sample App now has the various sections separated for easier reference. Once you run the app , clicking on the RULES ENGINE LOGIC button guides you through various configurations for relevance and calculations.
You can check out the corresponding rules files under `assets/rule` to see how they are configured.

NB:
    - When defining rules, always prefix with the step name they reference e.g. if its a key `age` in `step 1` then the field reference in the condition should be as `step1_age`
      e.g. `condition: "step1_hepb_immun_status < 60 || step1_hepb_immun_status > 100"` or if field contains a value which is a list like the checkbox widget `step2_super_heroes.contains('batman')`
    - The name of the rule should be the key of the field it configures also be prefixed with its step  e.g. `name: step1_happiness_level`
    - The action of a calculation should always be an assignment to the key calculation e.g.
     ```
    actions:
      - "calculation = calculation + 1"
     ```
    - The action of a relevance should always be an assignment to the key is relevant e.g.
     ```
    actions:
      - "isRelevant = true"
     ```

You can also inject global values in the root of the json form and they can be used during the relevance/calculation evaluations. useful e.g. if you want to inject external settings that are part of the logic
 ```
,
  "global": {
    "has_cat_scan": true,
    "stock_count": 100
  },
 ```
Here is complete example definition of the calculation for happiness level which is configured in the sample app. Its value depends on the first name from step 1 being set to Martin (case sensitive) and a global value for `has_cat_scan` being
set to `true`.

```
name: step1_happiness_level
description: Happiness level calculation
priority: 1
condition: "step1_First_Name == 'Martin' && global_has_cat_scan == 'true' "
actions:
  - "calculation = 1"
 ```
 **OTHER EXAMPLES**
 ```condition: 'helper.formatDate(step1_Date_Birth,"y") <= 2'``` checks whether the date of birth is less than or equal to 2 years
 ```- 'calculation = helper.formatDate("19-12-2020","y")'```  gets number of weeks from passed date. you can also use `d` for days `m` for months `w` for weeks
 ```- 'calculation = helper.formatDate("19-12-2020","wd")'``` outputs special format `28 weeks 5 days`


6. More input field types:

 ### Extra input field types

 Field Type | Name | Description
 ---------- | ---- | -----------
 TreeView | `tree` | A stepped Selection View/Widget for nested selections eg. `Happy Kids Clinic` can be found in **Zambia Ministry of Health > Northern Highlands > Fort Jameson**. They all have to be expanded to get to it
 Barcode | `barcode` | A text input field with a **SCAN QR CODE** button. It enables one to scan QR code and prints the scan result in the text input field
 Date Picker | `date_picker` | This is a date picker view
 GPS Location Picker | `gps` | This retrieves the current user location from the GPS. The value is retrievable as a `latitude longitude`(LatLng Combination separated by a space)

7. Media, Image or Note display:

 ### Form supports showing/displaying notes, images and videos based on answers to questions.

 #### Sample Logic For Media
 ```
 "has_media_content": true,
        "media": [
          {
            "media_type": "text",
            "media_trigger_value": "I plan to breastfeed",
            "media_link": "",
            "media_text": "This is an excellent choice. You are making a good choice to give your child the best start to life.\nBreastmilk is clean and wholesome and provides all the essential nutrients and vitamins your baby needs for a healthy start to life. Give only breastmilk in the first 5 months of life including no water, tea, or milk or any other liquid and immediately breastfeed within an hour of delivery."
          },
          {
            "media_type": "video",
            "media_trigger_value": "I do not want to breastfeed",
            "media_link": "android.resource://org.smartregister.nativeform/raw/understandingbreastfeeding",
            "media_text": ""
          }
        ],

```
The field above would only be required in questions where there is a need to show any note,image or video based on answer to the question.
In that case "has_media_content" needs to be set to true.
The entire question field in that case would look like
 ```
{
  "key": "plan_breastfeed",
  "openmrs_entity_parent": "",
  "openmrs_entity": "",
  "openmrs_entity_id": "",
  "type": "spinner",
  "hint": "What are your thoughts on breastfeeding",
  "values": [
    "I plan to breastfeed",
    "I do not want to breastfeed"
  ],
  "has_media_content": true,
  "media": [
    {
      "media_type":"text",
      "media_trigger_value":"I plan to breastfeed",
      "media_link":"",
      "media_text":"This is an excellent choice. You are making a good choice to give your child the best start to life.\nBreastmilk is clean and wholesome and provides all the essential nutrients and vitamins your baby needs for a healthy start to life. Give only breastmilk in the first 5 months of life including no water, tea, or milk or any other liquid and immediately breastfeed within an hour of delivery."
    },
    {
      "media_type":"video",
      "media_trigger_value":"I do not want to breastfeed",
      "media_link":"android.resource://org.smartregister.nativeform/raw/understandingbreastfeeding",
      "media_text":""
    }
  ],
  "v_required": {
    "value": "true",
    "err": "Please answer the question"
  }
}
 ```
In the above case if the answer "I plan to breastfeed" is selected in the spinner then the respective media which has corresponding "media_trigger_value" will be shown.
Three types of media are supported right now : "text","video" and "image".
Links to the "video" and "image" needs to be provided in the "media_link" field.
In case of showing both image and text in dialog , the "media_type" should be "image" and the text to be shown should be included in "media_text".
In case of showing both video and text in dialog , the "media_type" should be "image" and the text to be shown should be included in "media_text".
In case of showing only text in dialog , the "media_type" should be "text" and the text to be shown should be included in "media_text".


### Repeating group

This section provides documentation on how to use the Json Forms repeating group widget.

The repeating group widget allows for replication of a single form definition where the user can define
a form layout once, using the normal Json Forms syntax, and the layout can be replicated a number of
times as specified by the user.

The repeating group comprises of an edit text field (henceforth referred to as the `reference edit text`)
that is used to specify the number of repeating group elements the user would like to generate and the
repeating group layout definition defined in Json. In cases where you want to use a value from another edit_text,
specify the address of edit text on the optional property `reference_edit_text` eg.

```json

  ....
      {
        "key": "dips",
        "type": "repeating_group",
        "reference_edit_text": "step1:larval_count",
        "reference_edit_text_hint":"# of dips",
        "repeating_group_label": "dip",
        "openmrs_entity_parent": "",
        "openmrs_entity": "",
        "openmrs_entity_id": "",
  ...
```

The embedded edit text field is the default in case this property is defined, the address is incorrect or the
edit_text referenced in the property does not have a valid value.

To specify the repeating group layout, add its Json definition to the value field in the repeating group widget.

The repeating group form layout definition follows the same format as the regular Json form.

An example can be seen below:

```
{
  "count": "1",
  "encounter_type": "larval_dipping",
  "entity_id": "",

One can also specify the hint in the reference edit text and the label that appears before each repeating group element (an incrementing number starting from 1 will be appended to this label).

Relevance and validation is respected in the repeating group. However, validators that require comparing the value in one field with values in other fields (henceforth called `relative validators`) may not work.

At the moment, the only supported relative validator is the `RelativeMaxNumericValidator`. More relative validators can be added by overriding the `RepeatingGroupFactory#addUniqueIdentifiers(JSONObject element, String uniqueId)` method.

To use the widget, simply enter the number of repeating group elements to be generated (limited at 35 for now but can be overridden) and either click the `Done`/`Enter` keyboard button or click the tick next to the reference edit text.

After the elements are generated, the tick will turn green. At the moment, specifying a value in the reference edit text that is less than the current number of repeating group elements deletes the extra elements.

**NOTE**: At the moment the repeating group widget has not been tested with the rules engine



### RDT Capture widget

This widget uses the phone camera to take raw images of an RDT (Rapid Diagnostic Test) cassette.

The example below shows how to include the widget in a json form:

### Date picker change year,month,date position programatically
At DatePickerDialog added a method to set the ymdOrder called setYmdOrder.First at app side need to create a class which extend
DatePickerFactory and override the method createDateDialog.Then set the order at method setYmdOrder()
Example as below:
  ````
      public class CustomDatePickerFactory extends DatePickerFactory {
        @Override
        protected DatePickerDialog createDateDialog(Context context, TextView duration, MaterialEditText editText, JSONObject jsonObject) throws JSONException {
            DatePickerDialog datePickerDialog = super.createDateDialog(context, duration, editText, jsonObject);
            datePickerDialog.setYmdOrder(new char[]{'y', 'm', 'd'} );
            return datePickerDialog;
        }
    }
````
and initialize this to create a CustomJsonFormInteractor extend JsonFormInteractor
````
    public class CustomJsonFormInteractor extends JsonFormInteractor {

        private static final JsonFormInteractor INSTANCE = new CustomJsonFormInteractor();
        private CustomJsonFormInteractor(){
            super();
        }

        @Override
        protected void registerWidgets() {
            super.registerWidgets();
            map.put(JsonFormConstants.DATE_PICKER, new CustomDatePickerFactory());
        }

        public static JsonFormInteractor getInstance() {
            return INSTANCE;
        }
    }
````
and a your customjsonform fragment class initialize this interactor from createPresenter()
````
    public class CustomJsonFormFragment extends JsonWizardFormFragment {
    .......
    @Override
        protected JsonFormFragmentPresenter createPresenter() {
            return new JsonFormFragmentPresenter(this, CustomJsonFormInteractor.getInstance());
        }
        .....
     }
 ````

 ### MultiSelectList Widget

Getting started
Add the following field in you form

>       {
>         "key": "disease_code",
>         "openmrs_entity_parent": "",
>         "openmrs_entity": "concept",
>         "openmrs_entity_id": "",
>         "sort": true,
>         "groupings": "[A,B,C,D,E,W,X,Y,Z]",
>         "sortClass": "<fqn of sorting comparator class>",
>         "type": "multi_select_list",
>         "buttonText": "+ Add disease code",
>         "dialogTitle": "Add disease code",
>         "searchHint": "Type Disease Name"
>       }

    sort - default false, if true keys of the jsonObject will be sorted alphabetically

    source - if specified repository class will be used to fetch data otherwise options data will be used

    sortClass - provide a class implementing Comparator<MultiSelectItem> then in it specify your sorting preference

## Ways of loading data to the widget

 1. Using options attribute
Must not specify the `source` feld
```json
      "options": [
               {
                  "key": "key1",
                  "text": "text1",
                  "openmrsentityparent":  "",
                  "openmrsentityid":  "",
                  "openmrsentity":  "",
                  "property": {
                     "property1": "er",
                     "property2":"er"
                  }
               }
            ]
```

 2. Using repository class
 Must specify `source` field
Create a class implementing [MultiSelectListRepository]([https://github.com/OpenSRP/opensrp-client-native-form/blob/add-repository-class/android-json-form-wizard/src/main/java/com/vijay/jsonwizard/interfaces/MultiSelectListRepository.java](https://github.com/OpenSRP/opensrp-client-native-form/blob/add-repository-class/android-json-form-wizard/src/main/java/com/vijay/jsonwizard/interfaces/MultiSelectListRepository.java))  then add it the field json object in place of  `fqn of class implementing MultiSelectRepository class`

> `"repositoryClass": "<fqn of class implementing MultiSelectRepository class>"`

## Configurability

By placing a file named `app.properties` in your implementation assets folder (See sample app) , one can configure certain aspects of the app

### Configurable Settings

| Configuration                             | Type  | Default  | Description                                                       |
| --------------------------------------| ------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `widget.datepicker.is.numeric`  | Boolean | false   | Use numeric date picker instead of Android default |


## Hidden & Disabled Fields
Definition:
`Hidden` Fields: Changes the type of field to hidden.
`Disabled` Field: Changed the type of field to hidden then puts a disabled attribute as true.

To achieve this one has to add a form config file called `json.form.config.json`. With the following structure.
```json
[
  {
    "form_name": "anc_quick_check",
    "hidden_fields": [],
    "disabled_fields": [
      "leg_cramps"
    ]
  },
  {
    "form_name": "anc_test",
    "hidden_fields": [],
    "disabled_fields": [
      "hepatitis_b_info_toaster",
      "accordion_hepatitis_c",
      "syphilis_greater_5_toaster",
      "syphilis_below_5_toaster",
      "lab_syphilis_test",
      "rpr_syphilis_test",
      "glucose_test_type",
      "fasting_plasma_gluc",
      "random_plasma"
    ]
  },
  {
    "form_name": "anc_profile",
    "disabled_fields": [
      "flu_immun_status",
      "hepb_immun_status",
      "hep_b_testing_recommended_toaster",
      "fully_hep_b_immunised_toaster",
      "flu_immunisation_toaster",
      "immunised_against_flu_toaster"
    ],
    "hidden_fields": []
  },
  {
    "form_name": "anc_symptoms_follow_up",
    "hidden_fields": [],
    "disabled_fields": [
      "aspirin_comply",
      "vita_comply",
      "leg_cramps",
      "pencillin_comply",
      "toaster7",
      "toaster16"
    ]
  }
]
```
These values will be parsed and processed by passing it through `Form` pojo class in their setters.

# Multi Language Support (MLS) 

This section explains how the library supports language localization. 

An Android client application wishing to use MLS needs to take the following steps:

1. Provide a single placeholder-injected JsonForm where String literals to be translated are replaced with placeholders of the form `{{string_identifier}}`, where `string_identifier` is a unique identifier for the String literal being replaced.
2. Provide a translations property file that contains mappings of the `string_identifier`s from 1. to the actual String literals the `string_identifier`s replace in the JsonForm from 1. This property file should be stored in the `resources` folder of your Android project.
3. Append the name of the property file from 2. to the placeholder-injected JsonForm from 1. This would take the form: `"properties_file_name": "basic_form"` where `properties_file_name` is the key of the field to append to the placeholder-injected JsonForm from 1. and `basic_form` is the name of the property file from 2. Notice that there is no need to append the locale-specific identifier or the `.properties` extension.
4. Step 2. will be repeated for each language that the Android client wishes to support. 
   - The `string_identifier`s would remain the same but the String literals would change - taking on their translated versions for each locale. 
   - To distinguish between the different property files for each locale, the following [convention](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/ResourceBundle.html#getBundle(java.lang.String,%20java.util.Locale,%20java.lang.ClassLoader)) should be used e.g. `basic_form_en_US.properties` for US English and `basic_form_fr.properties` for French.
5. Set the `JsonFormConstants.PERFORM_FORM_TRANSLATION` intent extra to true when launching each JsonForm to activate MLS for that form (and its sub-forms if any).

The process of generating the assets in steps 1-3 may be a bit tedious and error prone. To this end, a utility is provided to ease the process. The tool (`JsonForm MLS Asset Generator`) is described below. 
   
# JsonForm MLS Asset Generator (JMAG)

This section describes how to configure JMAG for use with Android Studio.

JMAG is a pure Java class, meaning it DOES NOT and SHOULD NOT contain Android dependencies. Additionally, the elements it interacts with should not have Android dependencies as part of their instantiation process, otherwise the tool won't run.

JMAG is run through Android Studio as part of an Android Studio configuration. Here is some [background](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/rundebugconfig#opening) on adding an Android Studio configuration.

As part of the JMAG configuration, the following steps will need to be taken:

1. On the Android Studio menu click `Run -> Edit configuration`.
2. On the `Run/Debug Configurations` dialog, click `plus icon -> Application`.
3. Add the following configurations:
   - Name: `JsonForm MLS Asset Generator`
   - Main class: `com.vijay.jsonwizard.utils.JsonFormMLSAssetGenerator`
   - Use classpath of module: `<your-module-name>`
   - JRE: `Android API 21 Platform` (you can use a different API level)
4. Within the same `Run/Debug Configurations` dialog, specify the JsonForm against which assets are to be generated: 
   - Create an environment variable named `FORM_TO_TRANSLATE` and set its value to the absolute path of the JsonForm to translate.
   - This environment variable will need to be reset any time a different form needs to be translated.
   - Optionally create an environment variable named `JSON_FORM_INTERACTOR_NAME` and specify the fully qualified name of a custom `JsonFormInteractor`.
5. Press `Apply` and `OK`
6. To run JMAG: switch to your newly created configuration and click the `Run` button.

The final configuration should look something like:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33488286/77306006-0fc5ab00-6d08-11ea-8b35-559a6ef4308c.png)

Two asset files will be created under the `/tmp` folder : a translations property file and a placeholder-injected JsonForm. 

Alternatively, a different folder can be specified by setting the `MLS_ASSETS_FOLDER` environment variable, just ensure the folder exists and has the correct write permissions.

For a form named `example_form` the generated assets will follow the following naming convention : `example_form.json` and `example_form.properties`.

The properties file can then be copied over to the `resources` folder of your Android project under `src/main`. The placeholder-injected JsonForm will typically be copied over to the `assets` folder of your Android project (although not mandatory).

## How to use Sentry for OpenSRP Client Performance Monitoring

This section explains how to setup performance monitoring with Sentry on opensrp clients if you have added opensrp-native-forms library as a dependency. Instructions are given in this article on how to initialize Sentry in the opensrp client apps and how to check for the performance data or transactions on the Sentry dashboard.

> ### Note
>
> * You need to have already setup a [project](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/integrate-frontend/create-new-project/) and dashboard with the necessary access permissions, and
> * are able to obtain the dsn of this project through `[Project] > Settings > Client Keys (DSN)`. This will be required later for configuration and logging.

### Instructions

1.  Add and update opensrp-native-forms library to version above v3.0.4-SNAPSHOT

2.  Sync and rebuild project to ensure new dependencies are loaded. Sentry would come as dependency to opensrp-native-forms and would load up automatically. Run your application, and confirm no logs are sent to the sentry dashboard

3.  There are a couple of configurations that would need to be setup first for logs to. show up to the dashboard. These are:
      * DSN (Data Source Name); you can find your DSN in your Sentry project settings by navigating to `[Project] > Settings > Client Keys (DSN)` in sentry.io.

      * Environment; unique name that would be used to tag logs

    In your app’s Application class, add the following code snippet in onCreate with the placeholder values replaced . Run your application once more

    ```Java
        SentryAndroid.init(this, options -> {
          options.setEnvironment("YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME");
          options.setDsn("YOUR_DSN_NAME_LINK");
        })
    ```

4.  Logs in performance monitoring should show up in the Sentry dashboard. Use the Environment tag set from the previous step to filter environment.
